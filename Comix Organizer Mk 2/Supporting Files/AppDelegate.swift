/**
 swift @ version: 5.10.1
 xcode @ version: 15.4
 --------------------------
 SHORTCUTS (GENERAL):
 
 *  access quick actions (XCode 15) = cmd + shift + a
 > use to access 'minimap'
 > use to quick change 'theme' - current = midnight
 *  bookmark goals by right clicking a line
 > more preferably, type '#warning("message")' instead to have 'return to' items clear & present
 *  clean XCode build folder = cmd + shift + K
 *  create new code snippets: right click + "create code snippet"
 *  duplicate a line = cmd + D
 *  edit multiple lines at once: control + shift + click away then start typing
 > or opt + click & drag down
 *  edit this / saved code snippet: cmd + shift + L
 *  emoji keyboard: cmd + cntrl + spacebar ðŸ˜Ž
 *  force quit on mac: cmd + opt + esc
 *  importing UIKit also imports Foundation (never import Foundation if UIkit is in play)
 *  new XCode internal tab = cmd + ctrl + T
 > hotkey for this = opt + click any file in your project folder
 *  storyboard object list: cmd + shift + L (double check?)
 
 SHORTCUTS (HIDE / REVEAL PANES):
 
 *  hide/reveal debug & console area = cmd + shift + Y
    > hide/reveal console = cmd + shift + c
 *  hide/reveal left pane = cmd + 0
 *  hide/reveal right pane = cmd + shift + 0
 *  hide/reveal preview window = cmd + shift + enter
 *  hide/reveal minimap = cntrl + shift + cmd + m || access quick actions > type 'minimap'

 HELPFUL TIPS:
 
 *  App Icons & Image sets:
    >  https://www.appicon.co/#app-icon
    >  https://www.appicon.co/#image-sets
    >> mind light & dark views: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimage/providing_images_for_different_appearances
 
 *  Code formatting:
    > order = vars/lets, init methods, view lifecycle methods (VDL), funcs
    > 1 space after imports
    > 1 space BETWEEN class / struct / enum declarations
    > 1 space AFTER class / struct / enum declarations
    > 2 spaces after vars just before methods
    > 2 spaces between funcs
    >> no spaces on 1st line after func declaration
 
 *  Debugging
    > see Stanford: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRxHhx_pubY&list=PL3d_SFOiG7_8ofjyKzX6Nl1wZehbdiZC_&index=3&ab_channel=CS193P
 
 *  DispatchQueue-ing to main thread:
    > updating UI? - switch to main thread
    >> ex: DispatchQueue.main.async { self.image = image }
 
 *  Folders = instead of MVC, MVVM, etc. start with:
    > Extensions - "...+Ext"
    > Utilities (error msgs, constant enums, UIHelpers) - "...+Utils"
    > Managers
    > Models
    > CustomViews
    > Screens (VCs)
    > Support (App/Scene Delegate, Assets, the rest)
    >> except info.plist, leave this outside/alone
 
 *  Human interface guidelines: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines
 
 *  MVC = "Does my View Controller need to know about this?":
    >  basically if you see NO GREEN TEXT (ref's to props created in the VC) in the func, it can be refactored to   another file.
    >> the background color, border width, & corner radius of a container for an alert? No; Include in separate  UIView
    >> NSLayoutContstraints for the container? Yes.
    >> if a refactored view was referenced in the OG func and is throwing an error once you move it, pass in the view using: func functionName(in view: UIView) { }
 
 *  Network calls:
    > best to keep your .success, .failure & switch statement cases contained to 1-2 readable lines of code - factor out if need be. for example:
    >>    case .success(let followers):
    updateUI(with: followers)
    >> NOTE: not always possible, if it's 4 lines & depends on a complex completion handler, so be it
 
 *  Padding & constraints:
    >  whatever your fontSize is set to, give your label 4 extra points of padding in the NSLayoutConstraints below it  to account for letters that dip below baseline (y, j, g, etc)

 PROJECT NOTES:
 *  Biggest Struggles:
    > delegate & protocol method placements (who was calling what)
    
    > completion handlers vs task (async await)
    >> more specifically the placement of keywords: async throws, Task @ call site vs @ func declaration, & do/catch block placement @ call site vs @ func declaration
    
    > hash collision induced diffable datasource crash when loading new publishers (see note 14 below)
 --------------------------

 *  Publisher
    1. Coding keys steps:
    > start w plural "CodingKeys" for top level enums & expected nest name cases...
    > then move to singular naming convention if nest delves even deeper - docs
    > finally, after the enum setup, in your init(from decoder), link the top level key containing the nested container using the corresp. top level case - docs
 
    2. for nested items, start w final dest. then declare wrapper prop(s) in enum(s)
 
    3. below must be named 'results' as it "maps" to JSON's 'results'
 
 *  AllPublishersVC: Archived Notes
    4. see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QzdvsaMTDFkR5K3aL_i9YvgTQeATA5c-7xIW7G_8PG4/edit
 
 *  AllPublishersVC
    5. this is how the old tableView was set up @ the top. It's worth noting since it's unlike how I set up the tableView for the FavoritesListVC in GHFollowers
    
    let tableView: UITableView = {
    let table = UITableView()
    table.register(UITableViewCell.self, forCellReuseIdentifier: "cell")
    return table
    ( )
  
 *  PopUpWindowChildVC
    7.
 
 *  COLoadAnimationVC
    8. PROBLEM: WHY ARE MY DOTS LINED UP ON TOP OF EACH OTHER INSTEAD OF LAID OUT HORIZONATALLY & SPACED?
    > sltn: I had the 'animate' prop on the VC's initializers set to false
 
 *  AllPublishersVC
    9. OG logic for getPublishers( ) in place of everything under guard, let, else { }
    
        if let results = try? await APICaller.shared.getPublishers(page: page) { self.publishers += results } else {
            self.dismissLoadAnimationVC()
            throw COError.failedToGetData
        }
        configureTableView()
 
    10. calling configureTableView() here resulted in blank page when I was working with a tableView. I wonder why?
 
 *  APICaller & AllPublishersVC - Returning Error vs Throwing Error
    11.  async variant of urlsession - may suspend code, hence the await
    > (data, _) = type (Data, [unnamed] URLResponse [that throws its own error])?
    > ... i.e. it's equiv. to COError.failedToGetData - no need to handle that below
 
    12a. think the reason I don't need to return optional type here is b/c 'throw' accts for error & nil is impossible (?)
    12b. ERROR CORRECTION: refactored APICaller.getAllPublishers by removing incorrect do/try/catch block & including said block @ call site (AllPublishersVC)
    > also, removing the '?' after the 'try' resulted in the 'results' not having to be force unwrapped, which allowed the catch block to be reached
    > I also was incorrectly declaring 'async throws' @ the call site. Removing that meant I only needed to include the 'Task' concurrency wrapper inside the call site func, not the VDLoad
    > see: https://medium.com/@kuopingl/returning-error-vs-throwing-error-in-swift-8d3657e1330d
 
 *  Publisher
    13. Equatable is the base protocol for the Hashable protocol
    
 *  AllPublishersVC
    14. PROBLEM: I was getting an Assertion Failure crash from the diffable datasource when trying to load more publishers, incrementing the 'offset' param by 1
    > SLTN: I was setting the offset to increment by 1 when that only bumps out the very top result, leaving the rest of the 99 untouched (+ the 1 new result), resulting in a hash collision which wouldn't have sparked the crash, but WOULD have affected the search function's efficiency.
 
    > What I needed to do was increment the 'offset' param by 100 @ a time
